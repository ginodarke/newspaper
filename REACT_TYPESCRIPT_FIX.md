# Fixing React TypeScript Errors on Render

This guide explains how we fixed the React-related TypeScript errors encountered during deployment on Render.

## The Errors

```
src/components/3DElements.tsx(1,8): error TS1259: Module '"/opt/render/project/src/node_modules/@types/react/index"' can only be default-imported using the 'allowSyntheticDefaultImports' flag

src/components/3DElements.tsx(83,6): error TS2693: 'Canvas' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.

src/main.tsx(1,8): error TS1259: Module '"/opt/render/project/src/node_modules/@types/react/index"' can only be default-imported using the 'allowSyntheticDefaultImports' flag

src/main.tsx(2,8): error TS1192: Module '"/opt/render/project/src/node_modules/@types/react-dom/client"' has no default export.
```

## Fixed Issues

### 1. React Default Import Errors

TypeScript was complaining about default imports from React because the `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` flag wasn't enabled.

#### Solution:
Added `"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true` to the `compilerOptions` in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...other options
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    // ...other options
  }
}
```

This allows TypeScript to import modules that don't have a default export as if they did, which is needed for React.

### 2. Canvas Type Error

The `Canvas` component from `@react-three/fiber` was incorrectly declared as an interface instead of a functional component value.

#### Solution:
Updated the type declaration in `src/react-three-declarations.d.ts`:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
export interface Canvas extends React.Component<{
  shadows?: boolean;
  camera?: any;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
}> {}

// After (correct)
export const Canvas: React.FC<{
  shadows?: boolean;
  camera?: any;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
  [key: string]: any;
}>;
```

This properly declares `Canvas` as a value (const) that can be used in JSX, not just a type.

### 3. ReactDOM Default Export Error

The `react-dom/client` module doesn't have a default export, but we were trying to import it like it did.

#### Solution:
Updated `src/main.tsx` to use named imports:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

// After (correct)
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
```

Also improved the root element handling with proper error checking:

```typescript
const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
if (!rootElement) throw new Error('Failed to find the root element');

const root = createRoot(rootElement);
```

## Impact of These Changes

These fixes ensure that:

1. TypeScript correctly handles modules without default exports (React, react-dom/client)
2. The Three.js Canvas component is properly recognized as a value, not just a type
3. The application's entry point safely handles the root element

## Deployment

With these changes, the TypeScript errors related to React imports and Canvas components should be resolved. The build process on Render should now complete successfully.

## Additional Notes

If you're using other components from '@react-three/fiber' or '@react-three/drei', you may need to update their type declarations similarly - ensure they're exported as values (consts) if they're used as JSX elements, not just as interfaces or types.
