[Cursor] Fix R3F hooks used outside Canvas component

This commit fixes the error "R3F: Hooks can only be used within the Canvas component!" that was occurring on the login page. The issue was caused by React Three Fiber hooks being used outside of a Canvas component context.

Changes:
- Added AuthBackground component in Auth.tsx that properly wraps 3D elements in a Canvas
- Fixed AnimatedBackground component to ensure it has its own Canvas wrapper
- Ensured all useFrame and useThree hooks are used within Canvas components
- Improved component organization and styling to maintain visual aesthetics

These changes resolve the error that prevented users from logging into the application while preserving the 3D visual elements that enhance the user experience.
