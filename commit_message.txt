[Cursor] Fix TS2688 errors with individual module declarations

- Created separate declaration files for each project structure module
- Added components.d.ts, contexts.d.ts, pages.d.ts, and services.d.ts
- Created custom.d.ts for file extensions and wildcard module paths
- Added src/tsconfig.json with direct path mappings
- Modified moduleResolution to Node for better compatibility
- Updated main tsconfig.json with more specific include patterns
- Fixed the TypeScript module resolution for Render deployment
