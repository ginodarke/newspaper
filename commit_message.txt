[Cursor] Fix R3F hooks used outside Canvas component in Home and Onboarding pages

This commit fixes the "R3F: Hooks can only be used within the Canvas component!" error that was occurring when navigating to the Home and Onboarding pages. The issue was caused by React Three Fiber hooks being used outside of Canvas components.

Changes:
- Added HomeBackground component in Home.tsx that properly wraps 3D elements in a Canvas
- Created GlobeWrapper component in Onboarding.tsx to ensure NewsGlobe components are properly wrapped in Canvas
- Updated AnimatedBackground usage in NewsFeed.tsx (which already had proper Canvas wrapping)
- Fixed all instances where useFrame, useThree, and other R3F hooks were used outside Canvas components
- Rebuilt the application with the fixes applied

These changes ensure that all R3F hooks are used within Canvas components, resolving the error that prevented users from logging into and using the application.
