## Lessons

### User Specified Lessons
- You have a python venv in ./venv. Always use (activate) it when doing python development. First, to check whether 'uv' is available, use `which uv`. If that's the case, first activate the venv, and then use `uv pip install` to install packages. Otherwise, fall back to `pip`.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

### Cursor learned
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When searching for recent news, use the current year (2025) instead of previous years, or simply use the "recent" keyword to get the latest information
- When implementing a React application with TypeScript, ensure that the TypeScript types for React and other libraries are properly installed to avoid linter errors
- When testing React components with Vitest, ensure to create a proper setup file that includes necessary mocks for browser APIs like matchMedia and localStorage
- For Vite projects, define custom environment variables in a vite-env.d.ts file using the ImportMetaEnv interface to ensure proper TypeScript integration
- When setting up E2E tests with Playwright for React applications, create test files in a separate test directory and configure Playwright to start the dev server automatically
- For CI/CD pipelines, ensure that GitHub Actions workflows are set up with appropriate caching to speed up builds and proper test commands
- When deploying React apps to Render, ensure the render.yaml file includes proper redirect rules for SPA routing and environment variable configuration
- React Three Fiber hooks (useFrame, useThree) must be used within a Canvas component context, otherwise they will cause errors during runtime
- When working with Supabase, ensure field names in code match exactly with the database schema column names - for example, if you see "Could not find the 'categories' column" error, check if the field might be called "interests" in the database
- For better user experience, don't require users to complete onboarding immediately - allow them to browse the site first and complete profile setup later when they're ready
- When designing modern UIs, use higher contrast ratios between background and text for better readability and accessibility
- When encountering Supabase schema errors, implement graceful fallbacks and user-friendly error messages that don't alarm users with technical details

## Current Task: Improve Profile Setup and User Experience

[X] Fix the error with the 'categories' column in Supabase schema cache
[X] Update the user flow so users go to the homepage first instead of being required to set up a profile
[X] Add a profile setup link in the navigation for users to access later
[X] Update the color theme for higher contrast and a more modern look
[X] Add a more user-friendly error handling for schema-related errors

## Changes made:
1. Updated UserPreferences interface to match Supabase schema (renamed 'categories' to 'interests')
2. Changed App.tsx to show the homepage as the first view instead of redirecting to Auth/Onboarding
3. Updated Home page with a modern, high-contrast UI and direct links to both Auth and Feed pages
4. Added "Set Up Profile" links in the Header and Sidebar for easy access to onboarding
5. Improved the overall UI with higher contrast and more modern styling
6. Added better error handling for schema-related issues
7. Modified onboarding page styling to match the new modern look

## Lessons Learned:
- Supabase field names in code need to match exactly with database column names
- A better user experience is to allow browsing before requiring profile setup
- Higher contrast ratios improve readability and accessibility
